# Tally

## Background
Tally allows users to to create virtual Households to store their boardgames making it convenient to throw Game Nights and track wins. Each user has a personal leaderboard on their profile page, tallying wins by game. Households display users with the most wins and top winners for each boardgame in their cabinet. The goal of tally is to create friendly competition to keep friends coming back together to play.

## Our Plan 
Check out our original plan here: [Tally Original Figma](https://github.com/hollidavis/Tally/blob/readme/Tally.pdf)

## Future Improvements
- Email notification when your high score is beaten (you are dethroned)
- G-rated trash talk ("You're going down!", etc)
- Allow users to rate games
- Add a winner to the household leaderboard who doesn't have an account
- Show login form directly on the landing page instead of having a pop-up
- Give users levels based on the total number of plays (novice to master)
