# Tally

## Background
Tally allows users to to create virtual Households to store their boardgames making it convenient to throw Game Nights and track wins. Each user has a personal leaderboard on their profile page, tallying wins by game. Households display users with the most wins and top winners for each boardgame in their cabinet. The goal of tally is to create friendly competition to keep friends coming back together to play.
